# Huffman_MSDS-692_Project
Project Repository for Regis MSDS 692 Project

This project was performed as a requirement for the Regis University MSDS program.

The goal of this project was to execute an ongoing project from DrivenData.org with the intent of predicting whether individuals received the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines based on responses to the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.  This survey collected 35 variables on respondents including demographic information and opinions concerning H1N1 as well as information about whether respondents received either the H1N1 or seasonal flu vaccine; the project can be found here: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/.  While the data for this project is a bit dated, the COVID-19 pandemic has made information from this survey relevant again.  This survey could be used to identify populations that have historically been reluctant to receive flu type vaccines in order to better target advertising and information campaigns, which could lead to higher vaccination rates once a COVID-19 vaccine is released.
